### Changes:
- Another attempt to fix our FIO Parser on OS X. If you didn't run into any issues with the previous version, you can skip this one.

### Installation
Just select the zip file for your operating system below, download & unpack it and then run the executable inside. :)
If you want to move over your data from a previous version, just copy the `UserData` folder over.
