- You can now select to receive corporation HQ bonuses in your bases (thanks to NorseFTX!)
- Price Data Preferences are now configurable within the app and support per-planet overrides!
- Price Data Preferences now support NC2 and AI2 as well as any other exchange that might get added in the future.
- Reworked & optimized how FIO Caching works internally
- Renamed ROI to PP (Payback Period), as that's the accurate term for it.
- If an update is available, there'll now be a proper notification window. If you don't want to update to a specific version, you can disable that temporarily.
