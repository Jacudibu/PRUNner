### Changes:
- Maybe fixed an issue with FioParsing on OSX. If you still encounter the error, there'll hopefully at least be some logs to help me debug the thing. :)

### Installation
Just select the zip file for your operating system below, download & unpack it and then run the executable inside. :)
If you want to move over your data from a previous version, just copy the `UserData` folder over.
