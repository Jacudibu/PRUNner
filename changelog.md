### Changes:
- Some shopping card improvements by @Yawnder
- Price Overrides no longer need to be written in all caps
- Added a button to delete the FIOCache folder and thus update game data from within the app. For now doing so will close the application to ensure data integrity.

### Installation
Just select the zip file for your operating system below, download & unpack it and then run the executable inside. :)
If you want to move over your data from a previous version, just copy the `UserData` folder over.

### Troubleshooting
OSX: If you are running into problems on a mac, try launching the app via the terminal. Placing the app within your `/Library` might also cause issues.
