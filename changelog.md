### Changes:
- Added worst- and best-case price options. 
- Planets can now be searched by name.

Thanks to @Yawnder for implementing both of them!

### Installation
Just select the zip file for your operating system below, download & unpack it and then run the executable inside. :)
If you want to move over your data from a previous version, just copy the `UserData` folder over.

### Troubleshooting
OSX: If you are running into problems on a mac, try launching the app via the terminal. Placing the app within your `/Library` might also cause issues.
