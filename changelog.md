### Changes:
- Reworked how Production Buildings are set up – you can now set your production lines just like ingame and no longer need to calculate the percentages yourself! **⚠️This might break some of your base setups! Please double check your production lines after updating.** Opening both the old version and the new version at once should make it easy to fix.

### General Information
To start a base you'll have to search for your planet through the Planet Finder.
You can start multiple bases this way, they'll all be shown in your Empire Overview.

### Installation
Just select the zip file for your operating system below, download & unpack it and then run the executable inside. :)
If you want to move over your data from a previous version, just copy the `UserData` folder over.
