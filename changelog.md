### Changes:
- Added advanced building configuration settings: Press the gear-wheel button next to a building inside the base planner to set it's age to adjust production line degradation, or set a completely custom efficiency override.
- You can now select to receive corporation HQ bonuses in your bases (thanks to NorseFTX!)
- Price Data Preferences now support NC2 and AI2 as well as any other exchange that might get added in the future.
- Reworked & optimized how FIO Caching works internally
- Renamed ROI to PP (Payback Period), as that's the accurate term for it.
- If an update is available, there'll now be a proper notification window. There's also a button to disable it in case you don't want to update to the new version.

### General Information
To start a base you'll have to search for your planet through the Planet Finder.
You can start multiple bases this way, they'll all be shown in your Empire Overview.

Price Data right now is PlanetOverride > EmpireOverride > NC1Bid > NC1Average > NC1MMBuy > NC1Ask > NC1MMSell.
You can change the order or use any of the other exchange identifiers manually in the UserData/empire.json file. It will be created in your PRUNner folder after saving once.
